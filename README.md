# Estimate of Public Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub

* [See the historical count data in a CSV](ipynb_counts.csv)

A brief history of this project:

* Late-2014 to mid-2016: I wrote a script that scrapes the GitHub web search UI for the count,
  appends to a CSV, executes a notebook, and stores the results in a gist at
  https://gist.github.com/parente/facb555dfbae28e817e0. I scheduled the script to run daily.
* Mid-2106 to Late-2016: The GitHub web search UI started requiring authentication to see global
  search results. I stopped collecting data.
* Late-2016 to early-2019: I rewrote the process to include a human-in-the-loop who entered the hit
  count after viewing the search results page. I moved the CSV, notebook, and scripts to this repo,
  and sporadically ran the script.
* Early-2019: I found out that the GitHub search API now supports global search. I automated the
  entire collection process again and set it to run on TravisCI on a daily schedule.
* December 2020: The GitHub search result count suddenly dropped from nearly 10 million to 4.5
  million `ipynb` files, stayed there for a day or so, and then began climbing again from that new
  origin. I didn't have an explanation for what happened: GitHub updated how they count ipynb files?
  They did a massive cleanup of repositories? They were accidentally counting private repos before
  and arenâ€™t now? I stopped collecting data.
* June 2021: I started collecting data again but disabled the notebook showing the historical and
  predicted counts.
